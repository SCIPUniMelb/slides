# Becoming a digital researcher

## The digital toolkit of the 21st century scholar

### Greg D'Arcy

It’s very encouraging to see the positive response we’ve received to this webinar.

We have students, early career researchers, senior researchers and professional staff joining us, so clearly this topic resonates with people at different stages of their research career.

We also have people from other faculties - Health, Law – so welcome!

## .tip-block[False dichotomy of IT vs  Non-IT]

&lt;br /&gt;

## .tip-block[Suggestions on building your digital toolkit]

???
In my talk I’d like to discuss two things.

The first is to challenge the notion that you have to be an IT person to learn new technical skills. I would like to propose that (humanities) researchers have a tradition of using technology in the process of knowledge creation.

Secondly – perhaps on a more practical level – I’d like to highlight some of the trends we’re seeing across our SCIP consultations and share some advice on how to approach learning new digital tools. 

---

.left-column1[
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

###There’s no doubt new digital technologies provide the opportunity to open new areas of analysis and areas of research.  

###However, I would suggest technology has always played a part in research workflows and knowledge creation and so it’s a fallacy to suggest you need to have an IT background to learn new tools and methods.

&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
**Technology has always played a part in research workflows: the process that moves from raw data to coherent research question to insightful contribution.**  

* The ability to harvest, assemble and reuse data sets for research purposes.  

* Engage with, analyse and synthesise evidence from an array of different sources.  

* Design research projects and plans for locating, retrieving and storing information.

## What are the future knowledges and skills sets needed for the humanities academic workforce and graduates?
]

???
What digital knowledges and skills will humanities researchers need in the future?

This was one of the key questions posed in a project being run by The Australian Academy of the Humanities.

---
class: center

## *“The ability to analyse tools, collections, services, and interfaces; to understand the possibilities and limitations of digital data; and to reflect on technical and ethical challenges of collecting, using, and sharing data is seen as a vital component of the future &lt;br&gt; humanities skills set.”*

.footnote[
*The Future Humanities Workforce Project.* The Australian Academy of the Humanities. 
https://www.humanities.org.au/advice/projects/future-workforce/
]

???
And so It comes as no surprise that **data and technical literacy **was identified as the most important area for skills development for the future humanities workforce.

The ability to work creatively with such things as textual analysis, visualisation tools, data processing and machine learning.

Augmented by data preservation, collection, management and storage practices.

Digital tools that transform, combine, analyse, summarise, interpret and represent structured data are becoming central to the process of knowledge creation.

There is a need for a common digital literacy framework that can be used to inform and train future humanities and social sciences researchers to operate within an increasingly digital working environment.
]

???
Digital tools are becoming central to the process of knowledge creation.

And while researchers might engage with these tools in different ways, there’s a pressing need for training and infrastructure to support research within an increasingly digital working environment.

### Trends in early 2020
The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  

The prevalence and impact of data on our lives. Graphs &amp; Numbers are everywhere.  

Researchers unable to conduct traditional field work (looking to new sources of data &amp; digital methods).  

Researchers unable to attend conferences (f2f) researchers are thinking about how to reach their audiences over the web.  

Increased interest in developing digital skills.  
]

???
The Covid-19 pandemic has clearly impacted on the way researchers and working (and the wider community).

### Everyone starts somewhere 
Pick an area that’s of interest to you (a tool/research method) and go from there.  

Review researchers working in your field of interest.  

Follow virtual social networks.  

Try some online tutorials.  

Do some training (RCS).  

Come talk to us (SCIP).  
]

???
Everyone starts somewhere 
Prioritise your time.
Focus on one thing to learn as a starting point.

### Tools versus Scripts
**Tools** are great when you have a specific task to do. In many cases they are easily available and quick to use (eg: Excel).

The downside can be using tools can lead to dependencies on third parties which does not arise when using open source software. 

It can be difficult to replicate your process/analysis if you get new data or change your existing dataset.
]

???
It is perfectly fine to use tools (**existing software**). Tools are great. We all use different tools ever day to carry out a variety of our daily tasks.

Being reliant on tools does present some issues, such as dependency on commercial software or being able to reproduce &amp; automate your data wrangling and analysis.

### Tools versus Scripts
Learning to write your own **scripts** has the advantage of supporting transparent, reproducible and reusable research practices. 

Research projects and data analysis involve lots of edits and revisions. Using **Jupyter notebooks** or **R Markdown** let you to include to include your comments, live code and results all in one file.
]

???
As we’ve already established there’s a learning curve and commitment to learning to code. But learning some basic coding can save you time and effort in the long run.

**Jupyter notebooks** or **R Markdown** let you save your comments and code together into one file. Great if you need to come back 6 months down the track to recreate your analysis or share your work with others.

The payoff is that it’s easy to reproduce your analysis should you get new data, or there are changes to your existing dataset, as you simply run the program again.

### Caveats (or advice for my younger self)
You will hit **Dead ends** – lots of them.  

Treat your learning as a **personal projectment task** (Scope, Sandbox your Time, Dependencies).  
]

???
There are a few things I’d like to share that I wish I had of known when I began focusing on digital tools and coding in my work. 

**Dead-ends** – be prepared bc there will be lots of them. Be resilient (which I dare say is an attribute for researchers) and don’t give up. If you’re having a bad day step away and come back to it tomorrow.

**Project manage your learning** – commit to one area/one tool that you wish to learn. Commit to a set amount of time (per day, per week) to work on it, and give yourself a deadline.

### Caveats (or advice for my younger self)
**Pro** - code is easy to cut &amp; paste  

**Con** - code is easy to cut &amp; paste  

Things change and can go out of date quickly (code, tutorials on the web, text books)  
]

???
**Coding** - in many cases you may not need to know kow it all when it comes to a programming language or concept (eg: machine learning) but you might want to know about only one particular thing or method.

There are lots and lots of forums, tutorials, videos and examples of code online that are easy to cut, paste and run. The flip side is that the code can be often out of date (broken).

Even many textbooks on digital methods can be based on an older way of doing things. 

**It’s worth remembering that often tools can come &amp; go, so it can be important to focus on your understanding of the underpinning theoretical concepts and stages of your analysis.**
