## Snapshot

* Researchers want their own website to showcase and communicate their research findings with a range of audiences.

* Websites can house research outputs in the form of interactive maps, data visualisations, social networks, transcription and text analysis tools.

* All university-hosted sites use the stock Unimelb design system (Squizz Matrix or CampusPress).

* Custom websites using external hosting and development range from $5,000 to $50,000 plus ongoing running costs.

* External DIY options provide a templated site with a standard  subscription costing from $10 to $60 per month (WordPress, WIX, FourSquare).

Issues with some systems being open to viruses. Difficult to back-up and store content locked in databse tables.
